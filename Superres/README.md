## Dataset

The data is contained in a file called output.h5. The original music files are located under 'label' and the downsampled variants are under 'data'

We could not include this file since it exceeds github's storage limits

The music is divided into patches of length 2048 with a stride of 800. 

## Running the model

Simply run all the cells in Network.ipynb
